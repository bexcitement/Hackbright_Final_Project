For my cap stone project for Hackbright Academy, I am building a RSS reader.

I'm excited to have the ability to build my own technologies when others get "sunsetted" - like Google Reader did recently.

I'll be building the full stack - using MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Python and Flask on the back-end and JavaScript, CSS and HTML on the front-end.
